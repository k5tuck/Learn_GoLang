# Packages in Go

## What is a Package?

A package in Go is basically a **directory** of multiple files, that that provides a single entry/exit point for various functions.
If you have done any programming in JavaScript, it is similar to modules when working with Node.js. It provides a way to import various functions, (**_or features_**), from files that another developer has already created.

Every Go program will have a package assigned to it.

## Types of Packages

There are different types of packages that you can call in Go, or rather different "ways" to call packages in Go.
